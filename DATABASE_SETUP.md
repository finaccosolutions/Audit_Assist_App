# Database Setup Instructions

## Important: Apply Database Migration

The application requires a database schema to be set up in your Supabase instance. The migration file is located at:

```
supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
```

### How to Apply the Migration

You have several options to apply this migration:

#### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard at https://app.supabase.com
2. Navigate to the **SQL Editor** section in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
5. Paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** to execute the migration

#### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI

If you have the Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
supabase db push
```

#### Option 3: Direct PostgreSQL Connection

If you have access to the PostgreSQL connection string:

```bash
psql <your-connection-string> < supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
```

## What the Migration Creates

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors:

1. Make sure you're connected to the correct Supabase project
2. Ensure you have sufficient permissions (you need to be the project owner or have admin access)
